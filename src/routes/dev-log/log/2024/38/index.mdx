# Audio Hell

First things first is a audio app.

I made this because my headphones were making odd noises at certain frequencies, and I could not find a good free online frequency generator for mono and stereo audio. <br/>
**Soooo, I made one.** [Audio Helper](https://audio-helper.mauroner.net)

While it is not perfect, it is a good start. I will be adding more features to it in the future, but for now it is a simple frequency generator. If you find problems or want to suggest features, [please let me know](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/audio-helper/issues).

# Making a Calendar is hard

This one I've had in mind for a long time, as I wanted to make a calendar similar to [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai) but with a few changes, and inspirations from [Akiflow](https://akiflow.com/)

Since I've had some free time, I decided to start working on it.

## The Stack

- **Starter**: [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/)
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.js with Drizzle and Postgres
- **Hosting**: probably Vercel, but I might play with [coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) to allow for websocket connections
- **UI**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui
- **API**: tRPC and next server actions

## The Features

What I want to build, like the MVP of my calendar app:

- an automatically generating calendar like [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai)
- a direct way to modify calendar events like [akiflow](https://akiflow.com/) so I don't need to use google calendar in addition to my calendar
- CRUD for events
- a way to add habits and routines
