# Getting tags working

This week my main focus was on getting the tag system working.
With the main idea being that I can work on more important stuff in the future and so that it's easier to search my site for more important information. 

The main idea was to have a list of all available tags, with all blogs and dev-logs showing next to the tags.
Since the tags are supposed to be easiliy searchable and extractable from the markdown files themselves I had to work around those limitations a bit. 
In addition I also wanted to revamp the styling as I didn't really like the old styling. So the styling also got a bit improved.

Now the only thing that I had to do was make it so that each time you click a tag on 
[https://www.mauroner.net/tags/](https://www.mauroner.net/tags/) it pushes the new "path" to the history so that navigation works.

Tags solve problem
