# Getting tags working

This week my main focus was on getting the tag system working.
With the main idea being that I might want to search my own page in the future. In addition it's better to categorize the content.

The concept was to have a list of all available tags, with all blogs and dev-logs showing next to the tags.
Since the tags are supposed to be easiliy searchable and extractable from the markdown files themselves I had to work around those limitations a bit. 
In addition I also wanted to revamp the styling as I didn't really like the old styling. So the styling also got a bit improved.

Now the only thing that I had to do was make it so that each time you click a tag on 
[https://www.mauroner.net/tags/](/tags/) it pushes the new "path" to the history so that navigation works. 
Then the last remaining problem was that the `checked` status would not update correctly when switching between selected tags. 
The fix for that was adding a `useVisibleTask$`  Then 
to get the `window.location.pathname` information  on page load. 

Now if you visite the [page](/tags/) it should work as expected.

# NVIM


So for some reason youtube decided to reccomend this video to me

which then made want to try out `nvim`. I knew some of the basics but I had never used vim outside of vi/vim and VSCode before.

So the first thing I did afterwards was look if there was a quickstart and wouldn't you know it there was.

With this I set up my nvim config and started to play around with it. I also started to install my own plugins and configure some stuff.

Afterwards I saw this video which explained some stuff in more detail and showed some of the cool parts of nvim.

While working on this I was thinking that I would like to have a setup file which I download, execute and then I can just use it on any machine and have my setup completely configured.

So I added it to the nvim config. It uses ansible to install the different packages needed. 
This is the repo: [kickstart github](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/kickstart.nvim)

This is how it looks like now
