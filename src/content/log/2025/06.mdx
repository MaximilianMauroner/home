## ü§ñ Study Helper

I've been starting to work on the study-helper, which is an AI-powered study assistant for better learning.
While using a pay as you go plan by allowing for your own AI key or use the one provided if you pay a subscription.

<Image
  src={StudyHelper}
  alt="AI Chat app visaul representation of the study helper"
  class={"relative hover:z-20 hover:scale-150 hover:cursor-zoom-in"}
  loading={"eager"}
/>

This is more or less how it will look like, but I will continue to work on the design and the features.
Like the emojis will be replaced with icons, and right now it's not functional beside the chat.
And the sidebar links and text will also get changed.

### üéØ Key Features

- bring your own KEY, to make sure that you don't pay for what you don't use
- choose your own model, right now only GEMINI is supported, but later on openai and others will come
- support for file-uploads and image uploads and projects
- create flashcard from your notes and files which you upload
- create summaries from your notes and files which you upload

### üí° How It Works

Right now it only supports non persistent data, meaning that once you refresh the page the chat is gone.
This will continue to be the case, as a default I don't save the information, and you can save it if you want to.
Additionally I will offer two options, either you can use the free version, where you can bring your own and all the information will be stored in the browser.
Or you can use the paid version where I will store the files and information in the db, and you can then access the AI either via your API-key or via the one we provide.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The project is built with the following technologies:

- [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) to create the boilerplate for the project.
- [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) to interact with the AI and handle all the streaming processes for me
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Styling
- [Katex](https://katex.org/) for math rendering

### üìù Conclusion
