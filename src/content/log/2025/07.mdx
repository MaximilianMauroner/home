# üìù The last Week

In [the last dev log](/dev-log/2025/06) I said would continue, but I found a really cool open source github repo which helped a lot.

- [chat.vercel](https://chat.vercel.ai/) - actual ai chat app with image upload and a bunch of stuff other stuff, such as "tools"
- [repo](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot) -
  the open source repo for the chat app mentioned above

# üöÄ This Week

Then I continued with this process by working on the creation of the flashcards and saving them to projcts.
And then I worked on the process of saving the entire chat(including file-uploads).
The former was a bit tricky, but for the latter I used [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/).

Meaning that right now you can select between different conversations, and AI models, with the option to upload any file and pass it to the ai
(some models can handle files better than others, but that is something I still have to work on).

## üé® The Design Changes

The design is basically a copy from the vercel app with additions from shadcn/ui
(which the vercel app also uses)

## üîß Technical challenges ahead

- how to handle long chats where the ai token count is exceeded
- how to handle multiple project files that exceed the ai token count
- manage files, and assign them to projects
- create flashcards with sources attached if possible, ideall the page and file where it's from so that I can quickly show it
- the entire process of handling the flashcard algorithm
- integration of more models and user ai keys
- usage data and subscription options via stripe
- and importat, by default I need to make it so that a user can not use my keys, and instead has to use his key unless "enabled" to do so by me

# üìå Week Gems

- I saw this really interesting article about writing blogs and stuff in general [Advice for a friend who wants to start a blog](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/start-a-blog)
- I also found a video about a platform doing something similar to what I'm doing called [Opennote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtmAYsCBgQY)
- Also the DANDADAN opening is straight fucking fire, so here are a few cool videos
