Alright, diving into macOS from the Windows world... and honestly? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Here's the raw, unfiltered RAGE dump:

- **Second Monitor GARBAGE:** Why does the taskbar randomly decide it's GOD and just sits _ON TOP_ of my apps? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Bug city population: ME.
- **Scroll Direction INSANITY:** Syncing scroll direction between a MOUSE and the TRACKPAD? This isn't just bad UX, this is LITERALLY A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS OKAY?! LET ME TALK TO THEM, IN PRIVATE (for no reason)
- **The "Hard Click" MYSTERY:** WHY is the default "hard click" some USELESS tertiary action?! Trying to click-and-drag with two fingers is IMPOSSIBLE because of this STUPID decision.
- **Second Monitors, AGAIN:** They just feel... BROKEN. Something about the integration or management is fundamentally WRONG.
- **Battery Life:** Okay, FINE. Credit where it's due: The battery life is _insanely_ good. Mega props for that. ONE THING THEY GOT RIGHT.
- **Installation ARCHAIC NONSENSE:** Dragging an icon to the "Applications" folder to install? ARE WE IN THE 90s?! Feels super primitive and WEIRD.
- **Command Key PLACEMENT FROM HELL:** Having the main modifier key (Command) right under the thumb instead of where Control belongs for the pinky? My muscle memory is SCREAMING. SO. DAMN. ODD.
- **The Haptic Trackpad VOODOO:** You can _DEFINITELY_ feel it's not a physical click. It's impressive tech, sure, but UNDENIABLY WEIRD. You get used to it, but it's NOT "normal."
- **Keyboard lighting LOCKDOWN:** WHY THE FUCK can't I disable the built-in keyboard lights when an external keyboard is connected?! Why does it have to be enabled, if there is no quick F-Key way to disable it later
- **Notifications? More Like NOTIFI-CANCER:** WHOEVER designed the notification system NEEDS TO GET FIRED. IMMEDIATELY. They're clunky, ANNOYING AS HELL, and feel COMPLETELY USELESS. Also this is a "DESKTOP" operating system with mouse input only, why is it either a small `X` or a swipe action....
- **Menu Bar CLUTTERFEST:** That top bar gets filled with random USELESS icons _SO FAST_. It's a DIGITAL JUNK DRAWER FROM HELL.
- **Uninstall ROULETTE:** Some apps just... DON'T HAVE AN UNINSTALL OPTION?! HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO REMOVE THEM CLEANLY? WHAT IS THIS AMATEUR HOUR?!
- **Folder View CHAOS:** Folders defaulting to a non-grid, free-for-all layout? ANOTHER CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY! Grid view should be the ONLY default. ARE PEOPLE BLIND?!
- **The FONT:** WHAT IS UP with the default system font? It just looks... OFFENSIVE to my eyes. WEIRD AND UGLY.
- **Wasted Space in Settings:** Why isn't the Settings app FULL WIDTH?! Feels CRAMPED and INEFFICIENT. MORE WASTED POTENTIAL.
- **FINDER. OH MY GOD. FINDER IS THE ABSOLUTE BIGGEST PIECE OF SHIT APP I HAVE EVER SEEN:**
  - HOW DO MAC USERS TOLERATE THIS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE?! IT IS UNUSABLE.
  - WHOOOOO MADE THIS?! WHY IS THERE NO CONTEXT MENU TO QUICK OPEN A TERMINAL IN THE FINDER?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! BASIC. DEVELOPER. NEED.
  - You CAN'T easily go _UP_ a folder level?! BASIC NAVIGATION FAIL. HOW IS THIS REAL?!
  - Where's a clear, persistent folder tree view?! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?!
  - Doing _ANYTHING_ feels like PULLING TEETH WITH RUSTY PLIERS.
  - Ironically, Spotlight search is MILES better at _FINDING_ things than the actual **FINDER**. THE NAME IS A LIE. IT FINDS NOTHING. IT IS TRASH.
- **Bracket Placement MADNESS:** WHY ARE the `{ }` and `[ ]` in such an AWKWARD, IMPOSSIBLE-TO-REACH SPOT compared to the standard Windows layout? CENTER-TOP?! SERIOUSLY?! WHO DESIGNED THIS KEYBOARD LAYOUT, SATAN?! IT'S LITERALLY THE WORST PLACE POSSIBLE.
- **Apps That WON'T QUIT:** Closing a window (red button) DOESN'T ACTUALLY QUIT THE APP. MADDENING! Had to turn off the STUPID "running indicator" dots just to PRETEND they're closed. WHAT IS THE POINT?!
- **Finder GLUED to the Dock:** WHY CAN'T I MOVE THE FINDER ICON IN THE DOCK?! LET ME ORGANIZE MY OWN DAMN DOCK!
- **SLUGGISH Animations:** The animations, ESPECIALLY the full-screen video transition, feel GLACIALLY SLOW and make the whole system feel LESS RESPONSIVE. SPEED IT UP.
- **WEIRD Display Scaling:** WHY is UI scaling presented as changing "resolution"?! JUST GIVE ME PERCENTAGE OPTIONS (100%, 125%, 150%) LIKE A NORMAL OS! I'm NOT changing the _display's_ resolution, I'm changing the _UI_ scale. IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
- **App Store MEH:** It's... an app store. About as CLUNKY and UNINSPIRING as the Windows one, so, EXPECTATIONS MET, I GUESS? STILL TRASH.
- **Disconnected Desktops FROM HELL:** Having separate "Desktops" for each monitor is SUPER WEIRD and CONFUSING. Switching focus requires MULTIPLE swipes or clicks across monitors. IT'S INEFFICIENT GARBAGE.
- **Mic Feedback LOOP:** My mic has hardware monitoring. Unlike Windows, I CAN'T turn this off _PERMANENTLY_. It keeps re-enabling itself. FIX IT.
- **Post-Restart PASSWORD PURGATORY:** WHY force a password login after restarting?! I HAVE TOUCH ID! USE IT! This just makes me NEVER want to restart.
- **Terminal Touch ID TEASE:** If the system is SO "well integrated," WHY CAN'T I USE TOUCH ID FOR `sudo`?! Typing my password every time is ANNOYING. INTEGRATE IT PROPERLY.
- **GIANT Escape Key:** That HUGE Escape key is WASTED SPACE. Could have shrunk it and added a DEDICATED FORWARD DELETE KEY. WAY MORE USEFUL.
- **The NOTCH:** It's WEIRD. The mouse cursor phasing _THROUGH_ it and UI elements hiding behind it is just... BIZARRE and UGLY design.
- **Inactive Window CLICK TAX:** Having to click ONCE to _activate_ a window before you can ACTUALLY _interact_ with it is an UNNECESSARY extra step EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHY?!
- **Ethernet INVISIBILITY:** Can't easily tell if I'm connected via Ethernet if Wi-Fi is also on. The menu bar JUST shows the Wi-Fi symbol. SHOW ME THE REAL CONNECTION.
- **Tiling GAPS:** Window snapping/tiling leaves GAPS between windows?! LOOKS MESSY and WASTES SCREEN SPACE. WHY?! IT'S SO UGLY.
- **Maximised Window GAPS:** Even when "maximised," there's often a TINY PIXEL GAP around the edge. WHAT IS THAT?! MAKE IT FILL THE SCREEN.
- **No "Remove from Recents" in Finder:** BASIC FILE MANAGEMENT FEATURE IS MISSING. AGAIN. FINDER IS USELESS.
- **Media Key MAYHEM:** The "Next Song" key DOESN'T KNOW CONTEXT. If Spotify is active but a YouTube tab exists, IT MIGHT CONTROL YOUTUBE. FRUSTRATING AS HELL.
- **Sleep Mode & Battery:** FINE, another positive point - sleep behavior is excellent. Very little battery drain. GOOD.
- **Mouse & Multi-Monitor HOSTILE?** The OVERWHELMING feeling is that macOS was NOT made for mice and multiple monitors. It feels like a TRACKPAD-ONLY, SINGLE-SCREEN TOY.
- **Bug SURPRISE:** Honestly encountering WAY MORE random bugs and glitches than I EVER did on Windows. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO "JUST WORK"?! BULLSHIT.
- **Random BLACK SCREENS:** Sometimes, my external monitor just goes BLACK for a second. STABILITY CONCERNS? YEAH, I THINK SO.
- **Homebrew:** Okay, this is genuinely nice. A solid package manager is ALWAYS appreciated. FINALLY, SOMETHING SANE.
- **Price** and since this is mac, every single "good" app is basically paid.... fuck that shit.

So yeah, that's the RAGE dump. Some bright spots (BATTERY!), but a whole lot of BAFFLING DECISIONS and PURE FRUSTRATION for someone coming from Windows. We'll see if it grows on me... or if I throw this thing out the WINDOW(s).

**While most of this rant is a bit of an exaggerated overreaction, there's simply so much annoying stuff that just doesn't make any sense.**
