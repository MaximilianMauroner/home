# Obsidian as a CRM - setup

So first of all you neeed to start by downloading and installing [obisidan](https://obsidian.md/).
Then you need to work on the way you want to organize your notes. I try to work using a modified version of the [johnnydecimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com/), combined with the para system.
<Image src={Johnnydecimal} alt="Folder structure inside obsidian" />
- Where i store Acive projects with task and everything related to them under Projects
- Areas contain anything that is somewhat ongoing but not a project
- Resources contain data i might reference later
- Sprint is just there for me to manage my weeekly sprints(not the agile kind)



## Why Obsidian
I choose to use obsidian since it makes it easy to export as MD, and after I found out that how powerful the quick-add plugin is, it just seemed obvious to use it as a CRM.
I tried:
- notion
- logseq
- capacities
- evernote
- and a few others i already forgot

and none of them had what I wanted, like this i control my data, but I don't give up the power of a database, I just have to trick obsidian into thinking it's a database.
For developers obsidian might be the best tool there is, as you can directly modify it, more on that later.

But for the obsidian to work like I wanted it to, some things had to change.

# Plugins:
I tried to keep the list as small as possible and only include plugins I cannot live without, and I excluded the ones which are included with obsidian. This is community plugins only.


## Dataview
Dataview is plugin that allows you to query your notes, and it's the most powerful plugin I have ever used. It's like having a database in your notes. I use it to query my notes, and to create a CRM like system.
And since you can use DataviewJs you can basically do anything:

This is an example where I can figure out how often I mentioned each person throught the year in my diary.
```js
const folder = "20 Areas/20.6 Diary/2024"; // Replace with your folder path
const pages = dv.pages(`"${folder}"`);
const linkCounts = {};

// Count unique links per page
for (const page of pages) {
    const uniqueLinks = new Set(page.file.outlinks.map(link => link.path)); // Collect unique links in the current page
    uniqueLinks.forEach(linkPath => {
        linkCounts[linkPath] = (linkCounts[linkPath] || 0) + 1;
    });
}

// Convert to an array, sort by frequency, and take the top 3
const sortedLinks = Object.entries(linkCounts).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]).slice(0, 5);

// Display as a table
dv.table(["Person Mentioned", "Amount of Times Mentioned"], sortedLinks);
```
## Diary - Data mangement
On that note, one thing I found that was very important was the mindshift, into linking (tagging) everything whenever possible. If you have anything that should be linked, link it to a date.
If you do it long enough you will end up with a graph of your life, and you can see how things are connected, and how/why/when you did what you did.
<Image src={Obsidiangraph} alt="The graph inside obsidian after i migrated only a part of my CRM to obsidian" />
Right now I have migrated not even 1/10th of my notion to obsidian, and it already looks like this. I can't wait to see how it will look like at the end.

# QuickAdd
Now to the meat of the subject, why I like obsidian so much, the quick add plugin.

This plugin is made so that you can quickly add and fill templates how you want, but it can do soo mucht more.
<Image src={QuickAddExamplel} alt="Shoing a modal pop-up where quick-add can be used to add movies" />

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/)

So scripts is the part where it clicked for me, how powerful this plugin really is. I wanted to create a new file (movie/show) and then autofill it's properties. As is shown in this video.

## Templates

But I modified the tempalte a bit.
```md
---
title: "{{VALUE:Title}}"
franchise: 
type: {{VALUE:typeLink}}
genres: {{VALUE:genreLinks}}
cover: 
status: 
rating: 
progress: 
total:

> [!question] # ⭐️ WHAT IT'S ABOUT
> - ⭐️ {{VALUE:Plot}}

> [!note] # 🌙 THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS
> - 🌙 

<image/>
{{VALUE:Poster}}

---

> [!done] # ✨️ + EXTRAS
> - ✨️ 

---

> [!tip] # 🪐 WHAT DID I FEEL WHEN FINISHED THE MOVIE/SHOW?
> - 🪐
```
And as you can see, there is a random `{{VALUE:Poster}}` in there, which is a link to a cover image. But I need that image saved in the same folder as the note, so I created a script for that.

## Scripts
```js
// Function to extract all links from file content
async function getLinksFromContent(content) {
  const urlRegex = /(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/g;
  const matches = [...content.matchAll(urlRegex)];
  return matches.map((match) => match[0]); // Return an array of links
}

// Function to fetch media and verify it's an image
async function fetchMedia(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      console.error(`Failed to fetch URL: ${url}`);
      return null;
    }

    // Check if the content is an image
    const contentType = response.headers.get("Content-Type");
    if (!contentType || !contentType.startsWith("image/")) {
      console.error(`URL is not an image: ${url}`);
      return null;
    }

    // Get the image as a Blob
    const blob = await response.blob();
    const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();
    const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);

    return { uint8Array, contentType };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching media from URL: ${url}`, error);
    return null;
  }
}
async function writeMediaToDisk(app, activeFile, links) {
  // Determine the parent directory of the active file
  const activeFilePath = activeFile.path;
  const parentDir = activeFilePath.substring(
    0,
    activeFilePath.lastIndexOf("/")
  );
  const attachmentsPath = `${parentDir}/attachments`;

  // Ensure the attachments folder exists
  let folder = app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(attachmentsPath);
  if (!folder) {
    await app.vault.createFolder(attachmentsPath);
  }

  let content = await app.vault.read(activeFile);

  for (const url of links) {
    const media = await fetchMedia(url);
    if (!media) continue;

    // Generate a unique file name
    const ext = media.contentType.split("/")[1];
    const fileName = `${Date.now()}.${ext}`;
    const fullPath = `${attachmentsPath}/${fileName}`;

    // Use Vault.create to write the image to the disk
    try {
      await app.vault.createBinary(fullPath, media.uint8Array);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error creating file at ${fullPath}:`, error);
      continue;
    }

    // Replace the URL in the content with a local link
    const localLink = `![[${fullPath}]]`;
    content = content.replace(url, localLink);

    content = content.replace("\ncover:", "\ncover: " + `${fileName}`);
  }

  // Update the active file with modified content
  await app.vault.modify(activeFile, content);
  new Notice("All images downloaded and linked successfully.");
}

async function processLinks(app) {
  const activeFile = app.workspace.getActiveFile();
  if (!activeFile) {
    new Notice("No active file is currently open.");
    return;
  }

  const content = await app.vault.read(activeFile);
  const links = await getLinksFromContent(content);

  if (links.length === 0) {
    new Notice("No links found in the file.");
    return;
  }

  await writeMediaToDisk(app, activeFile, links);
}

module.exports = {
  entry: start,
  settings: {
    name: "Link to Image",
    author: "Maximilian Mauroner",
  },
};

async function start(params) {
  const app = params.app;
  await processLinks(app);
}

```

This script basically fetches any link, tries to download them (if it's an image) and then saves it in the attachments folder. 
Then it replaces the text of the link and adds the filename in the page properties

## DIY
This ability in combination with the ability to add any css to any page, means that I can basically turn obsidian into whatever I want, without having to create a public plguin.
I can create my personal perfect system, while using a "somewhat" open source system underneath it(that being markdown, not obsidian).

**And that is why I choose obsidian as my CRM.**

# Shmmering Focus
The last thing I'd like to mention or give a shoutout to is shimmering focus. This theme is, off all the themes i've used, the best and most useful theme.
It does require some modifications but thankfully that can be done using the Style Settings plugin.
