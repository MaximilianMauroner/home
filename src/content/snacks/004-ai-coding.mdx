title: "Break fast and move things"
description: "'move fast and break things' is basically the default now, and AI-coding will crank that up even more. the real fix is boring: code review + managing agents well, so you don't ship the next outage or security mess."

**“move fast and break things”** - is basically the new normal for developers at least - but the funny part is that **fixing most of this is not complicated**. it's literally just **doing a code review** - which a lot of companies (especially smaller ones) are still **not doing consistently** anyway.

and this is not some “in theory” thing either - we literally watched a **bad update** take out a massive chunk of windows machines worldwide (CrowdStrike, July 2024). not even a “someone hacked them” story - just **shipping something with too much blast radius** and not enough guardrails.

i think **AI-coding (like it or not) is going to be the future**, but **reviewing the code** will be what really makes developers valuable again. that - and, surprisingly enough, **managing the agents that will be writing the code**.

because if you can **manage the agents well**, you can get a lot done with very little effort - (if you ignore the part where you then need to **review the code they write**) - but if you **can't manage them well**, you will get very little done without shooting yourself in the foot.

also companies which **don't do code reviews** will have a hard time adapting to this new way of coding, because they already have a hard time doing what's right when there is not a lot of code being written - what makes you think they will have any idea how to manage the agents properly?
They will just create bugs and won't have the instincts to catch the _weird_ failures.

and the scary part is that a lot of the worst incidents were not even “we had a bug in our app” - they were “we trusted the thing that builds/runs/updates our app”.

like:

- **SolarWinds (2020)** - attackers pushed a malicious update through a trusted vendor channel.
- **XZ utils (2024)** - a backdoor attempt landed in a critical dependency path (and thankfully got caught).
- **Log4Shell (2021)** - one dependency bug turned into a global incident response marathon.
- **MOVEit (2023)** - one widely used product got exploited at scale and suddenly everyone is doing the same fire drill.
- **NotPetya (2017)** - spread via a compromised update mechanism and caused massive collateral damage.
- **WannaCry (2017)** - patching discipline decided who had a normal week and who got wrecked.
- **Equifax (2017)** - the “basic hygiene miss” that keeps showing up in every security talk.

so yeah - my bet is that the future of coding is going to be **a lot more about managing agents and reviewing code**, than actually typing out every line yourself.
