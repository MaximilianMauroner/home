I want an automatic clothing system that handles washing, cleaning, drying, and then presents clothes ready to wear.

Also: equal wear. Every piece should get used the same amount so nothing gets worn out faster than the rest.

Then I should be able to pick from a few preselected matching styles, tap one, and the cabin opens with the right items.

Or I can just input where I am going and what I need to do, and it figures the outfit out for me.
