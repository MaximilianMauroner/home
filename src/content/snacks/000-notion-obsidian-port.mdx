There was a $5000 bounty posted by Kepano recently as an issue in the obsidian-importer plugin, and now we are seeing a lot of movement on the PR. Thanks to [Xheldon](https://github.com/Xheldon). Hopefully this works so that I can finally migrate my entire Notion workspace over to obsidian without losing data or functionality
