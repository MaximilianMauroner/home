## The Tip

Instead of checking if an array exists and has items before accessing:

```javascript
if (users && users.length > 0) {
  const firstUser = users[0];
}
```

You can use optional chaining:

```javascript
const firstUser = users?.[0];
```

Much cleaner! 🎉

## Why I Like This

It's one of those small things that makes code more readable and less error-prone. The `?.` operator gracefully handles `null` or `undefined` without throwing errors.
