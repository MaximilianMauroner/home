# Integrate Reclaim with TickTick
## The Problem ⚠️
Well since I'm a big fan of [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) 
and have been using it for like almost 10 years I would like to somehow
integrate it with my other favourite productivity app [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/). 
And since currently there is no reclaim integration for ticktick I thought I might as well "make" one.

## The Plan 💡

Prerequisites:
- You need to have a [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) account
- You need to have a [Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/) account and a subscription if you want to use Todoist
- You need to have a [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) account
- You need to have an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) account

Caveats:
- If you don't have a IFTTT account it will run only once per hour ...

## The Execution ✅
I've got a folder for everything University related inside TickTick (which are the tasks I want to sync)
![university folder](/log/university.png)

Then I create a project in Todoist where all my tasks are synced to.

![todoist project](/log/todoist.png)

And then I add the IFTTT integration which is very simple

If a new task is created in TickTick, inside the university folder create a new task in Todoist.

### Todoist Setup 🛠️

## The Result

The last thing you need to do is setup the integration inside Reclaim

# Conclusion 🤝
This is a very simple integration, but it works very well, the only problem is that it runs only once per hour. 
Maybe there are alternatives to IFTTT that work better but for now this should work well enough.

PS: I sent a message to reclaim support about this, and they said 
> We don't currently have an integration with TickTick, but I do see that we have a feature request for this though

Which could mean that they are already working on it. 🙏
