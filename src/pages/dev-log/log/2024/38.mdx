# Audio Hell

First things first is a audio app.

I made this because my headphones were making odd noises at certain frequencies, and I could not find a good free online frequency generator for mono and stereo audio. <br/>
**Soooo, I made one.** [Audio Helper](https://audio-helper.mauroner.net)

While it is not perfect, it is a good start. I will be adding more features to it in the future, but for now it is a simple frequency generator. If you find problems or want to suggest features, [please let me know](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/audio-helper/issues).

# Making a Calendar is hard

This one I've had in mind for a long time, as I wanted to make a calendar similar to [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai) but with a few changes, and inspirations from [Akiflow](https://akiflow.com/)

Since I've had some free time, I decided to start working on it.

## The Stack

- **Starter**: [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/)
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.js with Drizzle and Postgres
- **Hosting**: probably Vercel, but I might play with [coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) to allow for websocket connections
- **UI**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui
- **API**: tRPC and next server actions

## The Features

What I want to build, like the MVP of my calendar app:

- an automatically generating calendar like [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai)
- a direct way to modify calendar events like [akiflow](https://akiflow.com/) so I don't need to use google calendar in addition to my calendar
- CRUD for events
- a way to add habits and routines
- a way to tell the app that a day/time is to be considered blocked without showing up in my calendar (e.g. free time)
- vacation mode
- a better(and faster) algorithm than the one in reclaim
- option to add tasks with start time, deadline, and specific hours

## The Progress

First I wanted to do everyting myself thinking "how hard can this be". How wrong I was. As soon as I started working on the drag and drop of the calendar the difficulty dawned on me. I had to rethink my approach and decided to use [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar)

So I gave up and selected a package that does most of the work for me. I first tried [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar), but then after a bit more research I found [Schedule-X](https://schedule-x.dev/).
And this calendar and it's ability to be customized is amazing. I can't wait to see how it will look in the end. Especially since I can use it with tRPC and next server actions and since it has the option to add plugins

# Homepage

i also updated my homepage, so the page you are currently reading this on. This page uses qwik and every "blog"-ish page uses mdx. 
But there were some things i couldn't figure out, like dynamically loading tags for blogs, and dynamically loading blogs.

But recently I found a github issue which solved this for me in a very nice way.

```typescript
export function getLogs() {
  const modules = import.meta.glob("./log/**/*.mdx", { eager: true });

  const logs: Log[] = [];
  for (const path in modules) {
    // @ts-ignore
    const fM = modules[path].frontmatter;
    const url = path.replace("./", "/dev-log/").replace("/index.mdx", "");
    logs.push({
      title: fM?.title ?? "",
      description: fM?.description ?? "",
      tags: fM?.tags ?? [],
      published: fM?.published ?? false,
      url,
      releaseDate: fM?.releaseDate ?? new Date().toISOString(),
    });
  }
  return logs;
}
```

This code (while not perfect) is way better than anything else i've found, espescially considering that this works on serverless
